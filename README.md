# Samsung Care+ AI – Autonomous Device Health & Support Ecosystem

## Overview
Samsung Care+ AI is an always-on **device health companion** that monitors all Samsung devices — smartphones, TVs, appliances, and wearables — using multimodal AI.  
It predicts failures, performs remote fixes, and coordinates service **without human intervention**.  

The solution is powered by a **multi-agent system** with specialized AI agents for:
- Diagnostics
- Predictive Maintenance
- Customer Interaction
- Service Coordination
- System Optimization

This ensures **proactive support**, reducing downtime, extending device lifespan, and providing a seamless user experience.
